idea: game where you have to stretch the window to complete levels

if:
distance between 
var xdist = (arguments[i].updPointTable[b][0]-arguments[j].updPointTable[z][0]);
var ydist = (arguments[i].updPointTable[b][1]-arguments[j].updPointTable[z][1]);
((xdist > -Physics.collisionAccuracy && xdist < Physics.collisionAccuracy) && (ydist > -Physics.collisionAccuracy && ydist < Physics.collisionAccuracy))

stuff to do:
implement weight per character
frame independent phyics
fix slow replaceat functions in render
add collidingwith to collision detection
middle collision detection w/bounding box to narrow broad->narrow objects even more
finish type fixes collision detection
match jump time to timer in top left

done:
collision detection calculating shapes in j twice fix done
collision detection calculating shape with itself fix done
