# ASCII-Physics-Engine
Physics.js is a vanilla JavaScript-based ASCII rendering engine that runs fully in text, no <canvas> or <video> element required. The only dependency is a browser with JavaScript and the script HelpLib.js, it even runs on my kindle paperwhite!

# Installation
To download, simply clone the repository to your computer or click the green "Clone or Download" and select "Download ZIP". The library is contained in dist/unminified for the raw version with comments, and dist/minified for the minified version.

# Use
To use, you must first include the libraries in html, like so:


    ```<script src="/path/to/physics.js"></script>
    <script src="/path/to/helpLib.js"></script>
    <script src="/path/to/stats.js"></script>```
